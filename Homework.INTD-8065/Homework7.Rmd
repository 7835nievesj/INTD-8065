# HOMEWORK 7

Interpret the coefficients of the selected model for the prostate cancer data in terms of odds. You can follow the analysis in the rotavirus vaccine example.

###### Make generalized linear model of prostate data frame
```{r}
prostate.lm <- glm(Nodes ~ Xray + Stage, family = binomial)
summary(prostate.lm)
```

The odds ratio corresponding to the Xray is
```{r}
exp(2.1194)
```

The odds ratio corresponding to the Stage is
```{r}
exp(1.5883)
```

```{r}
predictions <- cbind(Xray, Stage, 
                + round(predict(prostate.lm, type = "response"), 4))

```
This shows that there is a higher propability of identifying prostate cancer nodes performing an Xray procedure before surgery, compared to identifying the stage of the node with finger palpations.
